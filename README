Net::Goofey


This is a really simple module for communicating with a Goofey server.

Goofey is a bit like IRC and a bit like ICQ and a bit like email, it's
used mostly at Monash University.  See the Goofey web page at:
   http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~tym/goofey.html

INSTALLING
==========

After unzipping and untarring the distribution directory, you install
the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

NOTE:  You'll need a Goofey username/password to 'make test'
       successfully.

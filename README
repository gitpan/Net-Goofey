Net::Goofey


This is a really simple module for communicating with a Goofey server.

Goofey is a bit like IRC and a bit like ICQ and a bit like email, it's
used mostly at Monash University.  See the Goofey web page at:
   http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~tym/goofey.html


Contacting me:  gossamer@tertius.net.au is best.


Notes:

   Client.pl is pretty complete.


   If you want to write your own client using Net::Goofey, note that
   you can use do_request to either bypass the built_in functions or
   to add new functionality.  It just takes arguments of anything you
   would put on the regular goofey command line, eg to get the
   functionality of 'goofey -N' just execute
      &do_request('N');
